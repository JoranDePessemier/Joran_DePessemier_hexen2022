# Joran_DePessemier_hexen2022

Start screen was added by using a scene that immedeately loads on top of the game scene when starting a game. It is then pushed into the state stack and popped back out when needed. 
Meteor was added in the movesetcollection and as a prefab in the HandView (HandView monobehaviour is a component of the CenterCanvas).
